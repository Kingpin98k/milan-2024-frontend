          "SRM Social club is organizing a Pet Adoption event at the Milan fest. This whole world is filled with monotonous situations at certain time intervals. In some cases mankind has become its own enemy. But one beautiful thing that can be felt as an emotion is the love from pets that we get through their enchanting smile. At this event we inculcate the strong benefits in adopting a pet and giving them a life. Gallery of pictures of pups found in our campus will be displayed for those interested in adopting. In some cases when we are unable to adopt one and support them with our own care directly then we can at least make our possible effort in donating our contribution to organizations that support pets. Visit our “Paw shop” stall to bring a change in the world of a puppy!",
